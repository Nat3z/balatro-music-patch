# Balatro Music Patcher

A simple program for patching custom music into Balatro.
(Specifically Dom Palombi's covers.)

On Windows this program uses 7zip to replace in-game files with the custom music.
If 7zip is not installed, the program will download it for you, but it is
recommended to install it yourself. [here](https://www.7-zip.org/)
